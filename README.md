PCA and EVP are classic methods of dimensionality manipulation in the field of Data Represenations. I this field we focus on the conversion of Big Data into Data with dimensions small enough to perform quick and efficient operations on it such as MDS (Multi-Dimesional Scaling), PCA, EVP etc.

Also, the above specified methods can be and are used for feature selection as well as feature extraction.
